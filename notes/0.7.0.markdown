This release, is a major upgrade, a long overdue one, to play-yeoman bringing the required play version to 2.3.0. This will also be thee first release in which I don't think I have any contributions and the major work comes from single commiter, *Shiti* ([@eraoferrors](http://twitter.com/eraoferrors) | [github](https://github.com/Shiti))

New in this release -

+ Support Play 2.3.0
+ Built on sbt-web
+ Using start script generated from stage task works. Github issue #36

Some other good things for the project are -

+ Our "known active" user base is over 25 developers
+ We have got 180 stars in Github!

So go ahead and enjoy the new build!
Please do report any issues you find to the project on Github.
